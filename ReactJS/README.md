### React Work

React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory - Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.<br>

React only changes what needs to be changed!
  
### Start

* ##### React Directly in HTML
  By Include three CDN's in your HTML file.<br>
  
  This way of using React can be OK for testing purposes, but for production you will need to set up a React environment.
  
* ##### Setting up a React Environment
  * Install create-react-app : npm install -g create-react-app
  * Create a React application : npx create-react-app myfirstreact
  * Run the React Application : move to your application directory > npm start
