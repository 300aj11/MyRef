Fetch API
  The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (including across the network). 
  Fetch provides a generic definition of Request and Response objects (and other things involved with network requests).
  
fetch() method
  The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch.
  It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request — as soon as the server responds with headers — even if the server response is an HTTP error status. 
  Once a Response is retrieved, there are a number of methods available to define what the body content is and how it should be handled.
