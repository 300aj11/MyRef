JSON
  JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation
  JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
  JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.
  JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page
  JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
  
Exchanging Data
  When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text.
  JSON is text, and we can convert any JavaScript object into JSON, and send JSON to the server.
  We can also convert any JSON received from the server into JavaScript objects.
  This way we can work with the data as JavaScript objects, with no complicated parsing and translations.
  
JSON Syntax Rules
  Data is in name/value pairs
  Data is separated by commas
  Curly braces hold objects
  Square brackets hold arrays
  
JSON Data
  "Name":"Value","Name2":"Value2"
  
JSON Object
  JSON objects are surrounded by curly braces {}.
  JSON objects are written in key/value pairs.
  Keys must be strings, and values must be a valid JSON data type (string, number, object, array, boolean or null).
  Keys and values are separated by a colon.
  Each key/value pair is separated by a comma.

    {"Name":"Value"}
  
JSON Array
  [
    {"Name":"Value","Name2":"Value2"},
    {"Name":"Value","Name2":"Value2"}
  ]
  
JSON Files
  The file type for JSON files is ".json"
  The MIME type for JSON text is "application/json"
  
Sending Data
  In JS
    text = JSON.stringify(Obj)
    
Receving Data
  In JS
    Obj = JSON.parse(text)
