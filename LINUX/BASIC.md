### `pwd` : Present Working Directory
 
### `ls` : List

### `cd` : Change Directory

  `cd /`, `cd ~`, `cd ./path/to/destination/from/current/directory`, `cd /path/to/destination/from/root`, `cd ..`

### `mkdir` : Make Directory

  `mkdir directoryName`, `mkdir inside/some/other/directory`, `mkdir directory1 directory2 directory3`, `mkdir -p nested/directories`
  
### `cat` : concatenate

  We can use the cat command to look at its content.
  
  `cat file.txt` 
  
  If you pass more than one filename to cat it will output each of them, one after the other, as a single block of text:
  
  `cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt`
