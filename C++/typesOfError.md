1. Syntax errors:
Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language's syntax. These errors prevent the code from being compiled and executed. Examples of syntax errors include missing semicolons, mismatched parentheses, or incorrect keywords.

2. Logic errors:
  Logic errors occur when there is a flaw in the program's logic or algorithm. These errors do not cause the program to crash or produce compiler errors, but they lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior. Logic errors can result in incorrect calculations, incorrect conditionals, or unexpected program flow.

3. Runtime errors:
  Runtime errors occur during the execution of a program. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as invalid input, resource unavailability, or unexpected conditions. Runtime errors can lead to program crashes, abnormal terminations, or incorrect results. Examples of runtime errors include division by zero, accessing an out-of-bounds array index, or dereferencing a null pointer.

4. Linker errors:
  Linker errors occur during the linking phase of the program's compilation process. These errors arise when the linker cannot resolve references to functions or variables, such as missing function definitions or unresolved external symbols. Linker errors typically occur when there are issues with library dependencies or when there are inconsistencies in the program's linkage.

5. Compiler errors:
  Compiler errors occur during the compilation process when the compiler detects issues that prevent the code from being translated into machine-executable instructions. Compiler errors can include syntax errors, type errors, or issues related to the use of language features. Compiler errors need to be resolved before the program can be successfully compiled and executed.

6. Assertion failures:
  Assertions are statements used to verify assumptions made during program development. Assertion failures occur when an assertion condition is evaluated to be false. Assertion failures indicate logical errors or violations of assumptions and are typically used for debugging and development purposes.
