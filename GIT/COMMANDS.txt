Repositories (REPO'S)
	A repo is a container for a project you want to track with Git (e.g. a website project)
	Can have many different repo's for many different projects on your computer
	like a project folder which Git tracks the contents of for us
	repo's can be remote or local

States of a REPOSITORIES 
	Modified:
		changed files not Commited

	Staging
		Add any changed files to staging that you want to commit

	Commited
		Any files in the staging area are added to the commit when we make one
